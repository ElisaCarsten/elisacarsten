I am a clinical psychology graduate student at the University of South Florida in Tampa. I am studying under the advisement of Dr. Marina Bornovalova in the DEXTER (Dynamics of Externalizing) Lab.

My research interests span several overlapping areas, including LGBTQ psychology, personality pathology, and measurement issues in psychology.

I am broadly interested in the psychology of sexual orientation, including the latent structure and causes of sexual orientation. I am especially interested in factors influencing mental health disparities across sexual minority grops. Research suggests that lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals experience higher rates of mental illness compared to their heterosexual counterparts and that there is substantial heterogeneity across sexual orientation groups, with bisexual individuals facing most elevated rates. The minority stress model (Meyer, 2003) offers one explanation for these findings, although unresolved issues regarding the nature of sexual orientation and distinctions agross subgroups limit the conclusions that can be drawn regarding the factors influencing differences across groups. My master's thesis addresses these issues using statistical approaches.

Another core interest relates to the nature of psychopathology broadly and approaches to modeling personality pathology. [add more here later]

Finally, I am interested in the factors contributing to elevated rates of personality disorders (particularly BPD) among sexual minority individuals. These include methodological/measurement factors (e.g., do our tests measure the same construct across groups?), environmental factors (e.g., can elevated rates among bisexual individuals be explained by heightened experiences of heterosexism/biphobia?), and genetic/biological factors (e.g., is there any overlap in the biological influences of sexual orientation and biological influences of personality pathology, and what role does gender play?).
I am ultimately interested in exploring opportunities for specialized treatment approaches targeting risk factors among these groups in order to reduce mental health disparities among the LGBTQ community.
