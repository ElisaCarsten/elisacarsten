I am a clinical psychology graduate student at the University of South Florida in Tampa. I am studying under the advisement of Dr. Marina Bornovalova in the DEXTER (Dynamics of Externalizing) Lab.

My research interests span several overlapping areas, including LGBTQ psychology, personality pathology, and measurement issues in psychology. My work is informed by theories from many domains, including personality psychology, behavior genetics, psychometrics, evolutionary psychology, and gender studies.

I am broadly interested in the nature and measurement of psychopathology. This includes quantitative approaches to understanding the structure of psychopathological constructs, as well as psychometric issues in the assessment of psychopathology. In particular, I am interested in dimensional models of personality pathology and the influence of individual differences on maladaptive behaviors. Through this work, I aim to contribute to the advancement of empirically-based classification systems for psychopathology.

Another core interest relates to the psychology of sexuality and gender. I am very interested in the latent structure and etiology of sexual orientation. Is sexual orientation best conceptualized as categorical, dimensional, or a hybrid? How is it best measured? Another interest involves the formation of non-heterosexual and non-cisgender identities. For instance, how does the process of coming to terms with one's sexuality differ in lesbian versus bisexual women? How does this process differ across men, women, and gender minorities?

I am especially interested in furthering research on factors influencing mental health disparities across sexual minority groups. Lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals experience higher rates of mental illness compared to their heterosexual counterparts and there is substantial heterogeneity across sexual orientation groups, with bisexual individuals facing highest rates. My research seeks to uncover factors influencing differences across these groups. I am committed to furthering the integration of these important questions into mainstream psychopathology research and aim to the promote methodological accessibility of these constructs for scientists doing peripheral mental health research through investigation of optimal approaches to measuring both mental illness and sexual orientation.

Finally, my interests in the above domains converge in my research on the factors contributing to elevated rates of personality disorders, particularly BPD, among sexual minority individuals. These include measurement factors (e.g., do our tests measure the same construct across groups?), social factors (e.g., can heightened experiences of heterosexism/biphobia help explain elevated rates among bisexual individuals?), and genetic/biological factors (e.g., how does the overlap in genetic influences of same-sex sexual behavior and trait openness relate to increased risk for schizotypal personality disorder?). I am ultimately interested in exploring opportunities for specialized treatment approaches targeting risk factors among these groups in order to reduce mental health disparities across these groups.

I am also passionate about advancing diversity efforts in higher education and am an active member of my psychology department's graduate diversity committee.
